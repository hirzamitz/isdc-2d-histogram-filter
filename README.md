ISDC Project - Implementing a 2D Histogram Filter using Python

In this project, I've applied the concepts in lesson 2. Bayesian Thinking to implement a 2D histogram filter in Python.

This project includes the following files:

localizer.py - This contains the code that implements the 2D move and sense functions.
simulate.py - This contains the code for simulating the move and sense functions. 
helpers.py - This contains helper functions for normalizing the grid, checking if the robot is localized, etc.
writeup.ipynb - This Jupyter notebook is used for testing the 2D Histogram Filter
